# Consumer_behaviour_using_Conjoint_Analysis
Leveraging choice-based conjoint analysis, we explore consumer preferences for fish types and production methods, aiding marketing strategies in the food industry.
The exploration of consumer behavior in food labeling, particularly regarding genetically modified (GMO) products, is a critical area within the food industry. Understanding consumer preferences through analytics is pivotal for effective marketing strategies. In this study, utilizing choice-based conjoint data analysis, we delve into consumer preferences for different types of fish and their production methods.

The study comprises 109 consumers who evaluated nine fish profiles across various attributes, including type (tuna, halibut, salmon) and production method (wild, farm-raised, genetically modified). By leveraging a binary logit model, we scrutinize consumer choices, considering "salmon" as the baseline type and "farm-raised/genetically modified" as the baseline production method.

Our analysis incorporates linear utility functions, with price entering as a key factor, measured in tens of dollars. Through rigorous optimization using tools like Excel Solver, we derive parameter estimates that maximize the log-likelihood of consumer choices.

Moreover, we compute predicted probabilities for each consumer based on the model parameters, enabling us to gauge the likelihood of specific fish profiles being chosen. Additionally, we determine the derived importance of each attribute, shedding light on the factors driving consumer decisions.

Furthermore, we assess the relative value of different fish types and production methods. Insights into the dollar value of each attribute, such as tuna versus salmon and wild versus farm-raised, offer actionable intelligence for product positioning and pricing strategies.

Lastly, our analysis extends to market scenarios, where we predict product shares under varying price points. By computing own and cross-price elasticities, we discern the sensitivity of consumer choices to price changes and evaluate the competitive landscape within the market.

In conclusion, this study not only provides valuable insights into consumer preferences but also equips marketers and decision-makers with actionable analytics to formulate effective marketing strategies and navigate the complex dynamics of the food industry.
